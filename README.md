--------------------------

Study description
================
This study proposes that malaria interventions were effective in reducing malaria incidence during the period of their effectiveness, even when considering seasonal climate factors such as temperature and precipitation. We assessed the effectiveness of these interventions using monthly malaria incidence data for Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum in Loreto, Peru (2001–2019). Employing a two-stage machine learning model, we examined how both the "Malaria Cero" and PAMAFRO interventions contributed to reducing malaria incidence.
